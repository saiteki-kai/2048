# 2048 C++ Clone

This is a C++ clone of the popular game [2048](https://play2048.co/) from [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli).
The game is built using SDL3 and SDL3_ttf libraries.

## About

This is the first serious project I've taken on in C++.
I wanted to challenge myself by building a simple game while exploring low-level development and C++ tools.
